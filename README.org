#+TITLE: [[images/logo64.png]] matrix-client.el

This is a fork of the [[http://doc.rix.si/projects/matrix.el.html][original matrix.el client]] with the intent of maintaining
it further, fixing bugs, and providing long-term goals for the project.

* Installation

*Note:* This package currently requires Emacs 26 or greater.

** Standalone client

The easiest way to start using this package is to download the script =matrix-client-standalone.el.sh= ([[https://github.com/jgkamat/matrix-client-el/blob/master/misc/matrix-client-standalone.el][GitHub link]]), make it executable, and run it from a shell (not from within Emacs).  If any packages are missing, it uses Emacs's built-in =package.el= to install =quelpa= from MELPA, and =quelpa= then installs this client and its dependencies.  Then it runs the "standalone" client, which doesn't load any user configuration files.

The script accepts these options:

+  =--upgrade=: Upgrade the client to the latest version before connecting.  (This also upgrades the script in the package directory, but any changes to it won't take effect until the next time it's run.)
+  =--debug=: Enable ~debug-on-error~ in the Emacs session.

Since the script doesn't load any user configuration files, it's basically like a clean Emacs config.  However, it does initialize and use the existing Emacs packages directory (e.g. =~/.emacs.d/elpa=), so keep that in mind; any necessary packages will be installed there, and all autoload files will be read (which means that you can load any themes that you already have installed!).

After using the "standalone" client, the packages will be installed to your Emacs packages directory, so then you can also use it in your main Emacs config.

Of course, this is a rather unorthodox way to install and use an Emacs package, so if you are uncomfortable with this method, please do inspect the code yourself, or use another installation method.

** Quelpa

Installing directly with [[https://framagit.org/steckerhalter/quelpa][Quelpa]] into your Emacs config is also very easy:

1.  Install [[https://framagit.org/steckerhalter/quelpa-use-package#installation][quelpa-use-package]] (which can be installed directly from MELPA).
2.  Add this form to your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package matrix-client
    :quelpa ((matrix-client :fetcher github :repo "jgkamat/matrix-client-el"
                            :files (:defaults "logo.png" "matrix-client-standalone.el.sh"))))
#+END_SRC

After installation, upgrading can be done through =quelpa=, e.g. with @@html:<kbd>@@C-u M-x quelpa RET matrix-client RET@@html:</kbd>@@.

** Manually

Simply put this repo's directory onto your ~load-path~, and eval ~(require 'matrix-client)~.  Note that when installing manually, you will also need to manually install all dependencies.  

Once the project achieves a sufficiently high quality or demand, it may be submitted to MELPA, but that probably won't happen anytime soon.

* Usage

Either deploy your own homeserver or register an account on the [[https://matrix.org/beta/#/login][public homeserver]] .

Then run the command ~matrix-client-connect~ or ~matrix-client-frame~ to connect.  These commands are available in a room:

+  Join a room: =/join #room:server=
+  Leave the current room: =/leave=
+  Upload a file: =/upload PATH-OR-URL= or drag-and-drop files or URLs onto the room buffer
+  Send HTML messages: =/html=
+  See the user list: =/who=
+  Adjust notification settings: =/notify=
+  Enable pretty colors: =/rainbow=

The command ~matrix-client-frame~ opens a dedicated frame, like this (also seen here is the optional ~matrix-client-rainbow-mode~ that colorizes events according to sender):

* Configuration

While there are a lot of configuration settings, here are a selection that are
the most useful:

| Variable                          | Description                           |
|-----------------------------------+---------------------------------------|
| ~matrix-client-show-images~       | Control if images are shown inline    |
| ~matrix-client-render-presence~   | Control display of presence           |
| ~matrix-client-render-membership~ | Control display of membership changes |
| ~matrix-client-use-tracking~      | Enable tracking.el integration        |

Many more settings are documented through customize.
