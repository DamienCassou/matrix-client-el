#+TITLE: [[images/logo64.png]] matrix-client.el

This is a fork of the [[http://doc.rix.si/projects/matrix.el.html][original matrix.el client]] with the intent of maintaining
it further, fixing bugs, and providing long-term goals for the project.

* Installation

~matrix-client~ can only be installed manually. Simply put this directory onto
your load path, and ~(require 'matrix-client)~. Once the project achieves a
sufficiently high quality or demand, it may be submitted to melpa.

When installing manually, you will need to ensure all dependencies are also
installed properly.

** Quelpa

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (quelpa '(matrix-client
            :fetcher github
            :repo "jgkamat/matrix-client-el"))
#+END_SRC

* Usage

Either deploy your own homeserver or register account on the public homeserver
https://matrix.org/beta/#/login . After you've done that, =M-x matrix-client=
will set you up with buffers corresponding to your Matrix rooms. You can join
new ones with /join, leave with /leave or /part, and hook in to the custom
functions provided by =matrix-client=.

* Configuration

While there are a lot of configuration settings, here are a selection that are
the most useful:

| Variable                          | Description                           |
|-----------------------------------+---------------------------------------|
| ~matrix-client-show-images~       | Control if images are shown inline    |
| ~matrix-client-render-presence~   | Control display of presence           |
| ~matrix-client-render-membership~ | Control display of membership changes |
| ~matrix-client-use-tracking~      | Enable tracking.el integration        |

Many more settings are documented through customize.
